#  0. Will arp be enough ? 

Write a bash script that scan a subnetwork to discover live host using ARP scan.

- You should use nmap.
- Your code should tell nmap not to do a port scan after host discovery.
- You should run your code as privileged user. root or sudoers.
- Your script should accept a subnetwork as an arguments $1.

Depending on the scanned subnetwork, the output could change.
We can‚Äôt expect to learn about the Target MAC Address, unless we are in the the same subnetwork.

# 5. Are your privileged enough to scan me ? 

Write a bash script that scan a subnetwork to discover live host using *TCP ACK Ping * scan.

#  7. Simple Catch, is it mimicked ? 

Time To Ping The Target (cybernetsec0x04)

Catch the flag time is on, here is some tips:

- You should run your scan as privileged user. root or sudoers.
- The Current Flag is hidden within UDP opened port service VERSION
- Two hundred, Three hundred but no more. -p200-300
