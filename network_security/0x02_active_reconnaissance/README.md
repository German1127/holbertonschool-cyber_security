App

Endpoint: http://active.hbtn

sqlmap -u "http://active.hbtn/product/" active.hbtn --dump --dbs 

sqlmap: 
is an open source penetration testing tool that automates the detection and exploitation of SQL injection vulnerabilities in web applications

-u:
"http://active.hbtn/product/": Specifies the URL of the web page to be analyzed for SQL injections.

active.hbtn: 
Provides the name of the domain being analyzed.
