Task 0:

Your initial objective entails identifying the vulnerable endpoint and securing the flag located at /etc/0-flag.txt.

Target Machine: Cyber - WebSec 0x07
Main Endpoint: http://web0x07.hbtn/task0/list_file
Useful instructions:
1. Try to upload a file.
2. Check page source for evey endpoint.
3. Investigate links and how they are processed, and what parameters are accepted.
4. Experiment with altering the path and file names and check the result.

Task 1:

Your objective as usual is identifying the vulnerable endpoint and securing the flag located at /etc/1-flag.txt.

Target Machine: Cyber - WebSec 0x07
Main Endpoint: http://web0x07.hbtn/task1/list_file
PS : a filter has been implemented to prevent unconventional paths.

Useful instructions:
1. Investigate what kind of payload the vulnerable endpoint accept.
2. Try difrent path traversal methods to bypass the new filter.

======

Task 2:

Your objective as usual is identifying the vulnerable endpoint and securing the flag located at /etc/2-flag.txt.

Target Machine: Cyber - WebSec 0x07
Main Endpoint: http://web0x07.hbtn/task2/list_file
PS : a filter better has been implemented to prevent unconventional paths.

Useful instructions:
1. Investigate what kind of payload the vulnerable endpoint accept.
2. Try difrent path traversal methods to bypass the new filter.

======

Task 3:

Your objective as usual is identifying the vulnerable endpoint and securing the flag located at /etc/3-flag.txt.

Target Machine: Cyber - WebSec 0x07
Main Endpoint: http://web0x07.hbtn/task3/list_file
Useful instructions:
1. Create a rapport.
2. Try multiple types of payloads in the rapport.

======

Task 4:

As usual the objective is to capture the flag however this time the flag would be set to a random path on the server. to get it you will need to at least have a decent shell access .

Target Machine: Cyber - WebSec 0x07
Main Endpoint: http://web0x07.hbtn/find_your_shell/
Useful instructions:
1. Investigate what files you have permission to access.
2. Check paths under root
